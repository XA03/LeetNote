In the universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force between two balls if they are put in his new invented basket. Rick has `n` empty baskets, the `ith` basket is at `position[i]`, Morty has `m` balls and needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the **minimum magnetic force** between any two balls is **maximum**.

Rick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions `x` and `y` is `|x - y|`.

Given the integer array `position` and the integer `m`. Return _the required force_.

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  int maxDistance(vector<int>& position, int m) {
    ranges::sort(position);

    int l = 1;
    int r = position.back() - position.front();

    while (l < r) {
      const int mid = r - (r - l) / 2;
      if (numBalls(position, mid) >= m)  // There're too many balls.
        l = mid;
      else  // There're too few balls.
        r = mid - 1;
    }

    return l;
  }

 private:
  int numBalls(const vector<int>& position, int force) {
    int balls = 0;
    int prevPosition = -force;
    for (const int pos : position)
      if (pos - prevPosition >= force) {
        ++balls;
        prevPosition = pos;
      }
    return balls;
  }
};
```
