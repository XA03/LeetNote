Suppose LeetCode will start its **IPO** soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the **IPO**. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most `k` distinct projects before the **IPO**. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most `k` distinct projects.

You are given `n` projects where the `ith` project has a pure profit `profits[i]` and a minimum capital of `capital[i]` is needed to start it.

Initially, you have `w` capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.

Pick a list of **at most** `k` distinct projects from given projects to **maximize your final capital**, and return _the final maximized capital_.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

```cpp
struct T {
  int pro;
  int cap;
  T(int pro, int cap) : pro(pro), cap(cap) {}
};

class Solution {
 public:
  int findMaximizedCapital(int k, int W, vector<int>& Profits,
                           vector<int>& Capital) {
    auto compareC = [](const T& a, const T& b) { return a.cap > b.cap; };
    auto compareP = [](const T& a, const T& b) { return a.pro < b.pro; };
    priority_queue<T, vector<T>, decltype(compareC)> minHeap(compareC);
    priority_queue<T, vector<T>, decltype(compareP)> maxHeap(compareP);

    for (int i = 0; i < Capital.size(); ++i)
      minHeap.emplace(Profits[i], Capital[i]);

    while (k--) {
      while (!minHeap.empty() && minHeap.top().cap <= W)
        maxHeap.push(minHeap.top()), minHeap.pop();
      if (maxHeap.empty())
        break;
      W += maxHeap.top().pro, maxHeap.pop();
    }

    return W;
  }
};
```
