On a 2D plane, there are `n` points with integer coordinates `points[i] = [xi, yi]`. Return _the **minimum time** in seconds to visit all the points in the order given by_ `points`.

You can move according to these rules:

- In `1` second, you can either:
    - move vertically by one unit,
    - move horizontally by one unit, or
    - move diagonally `sqrt(2)` units (in other words, move one unit vertically then one unit horizontally in `1` second).
- You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.
- You are allowed to pass through points that appear later in the order, but these do not count as visits.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minTimeToVisitAllPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        int distance=0;
        
        for(int i=1;i<points.size();i++){
            int x=abs(points[i][0]-points[i-1][0]),y=abs(points[i][1]-points[i-1][1]);
            if(x==0)distance+=y;
            else if(y==0)distance+=x;
            else if(x!=y){
               int temp=(x+y+abs(x-y))/2;
                distance+=temp; 
            }
            else{
                distance+=x;
            }
        }
        
        
        
        
        
        return distance;
    }
};
```
