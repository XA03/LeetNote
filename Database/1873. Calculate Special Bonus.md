Write a solution to calculate the bonus of each employee. The bonus of an employee is `100%` of their salary if the ID of the employee is **an odd number** and **the employee's name does not start with the character** `'M'`. The bonus of an employee is `0` otherwise.

```MySQL
select employee_id,if(Employees.name not like 'M%' && (employee_id mod 2=1),salary,0) bonus from Employees
order by 1
```
