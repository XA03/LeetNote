For this problem, we will consider a **manager** an employee who has at least 1 other employee reporting to them.

Write a solution to report the ids and the names of all **managers**, the number of employees who report **directly** to them, and the average age of the reports rounded to the nearest integer.

Return the result table ordered by `employee_id`.

The result format is in the following example.

```MySQL
select A.employee_id,A.name,count(0) reports_count ,round(avg(B.age)) average_age
from Employees A inner join Employees B
on A.employee_id=B.reports_to
group by 1
order by 1

```
