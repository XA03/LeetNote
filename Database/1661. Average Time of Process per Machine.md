There is a factory website that has several machines each running the **same number of processes**. Write a solution to find the **average time** each machine takes to complete a process.

The time to complete a process is the `'end' timestamp` minus the `'start' timestamp`. The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.

The resulting table should have the `machine_id` along with the **average time** as `processing_time`, which should be **rounded to 3 decimal places**.

```MySQL
SELECT
  StartActivity.machine_id,
  ROUND(
    AVG(EndActivity.timestamp - StartActivity.timestamp),
    3
  ) AS processing_time
FROM Activity AS StartActivity
INNER JOIN Activity AS EndActivity
  USING (machine_id, process_id)
WHERE
  StartActivity.activity_type = 'start'
  AND EndActivity.activity_type = 'end'
GROUP BY 1;
```
