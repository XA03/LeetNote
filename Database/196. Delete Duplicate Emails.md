Write a solution to **delete** all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest `id`.

For SQL users, please note that you are supposed to write a `DELETE` statement and not a `SELECT` one.

For Pandas users, please note that you are supposed to modify `Person` in place.

After running your script, the answer shown is the `Person` table. The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the `Person` table. The final order of the `Person` table **does not matter**.

The result format is in the following example.

出現相同email時保留id最小的那份，其餘刪除

要跟自己篩選時絕大部分都會用join和別名再寫條件

```cpp
delete p1 from Person as p1 inner join Person as p2 
on (p1.email=p2.email)
where p1.id>p2.id
```
