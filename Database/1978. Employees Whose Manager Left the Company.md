Find the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than `$30000` and whose manager left the company. When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the `Employees` table, but the reports still have their `manager_id` set to the manager that left.

Return the result table ordered by `employee_id`.

```MySQL
select A.employee_id from Employees A left join Employees B 
on A.manager_id=B.employee_id 
where B.employee_id is null && A.salary<30000 && A.manager_id is not null
order by 1
```
