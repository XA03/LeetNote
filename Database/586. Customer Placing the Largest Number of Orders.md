Write a solution to find the `customer_number` for the customer who has placed the largest number of orders.

The test cases are generated so that **exactly one customer** will have placed more orders than any other customer.

```MysQL
SELECT customer_number
FROM Orders
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
limit 1
```
