Write a solution to rearrange the `Products` table so that each row has `(product_id, store, price)`. If a product is not available in a store, do **not** include a row with that `product_id` and `store` combination in the result table.

```MySQL
SELECT
  product_id,
  'store1' AS store,
  store1 AS price
FROM Products
WHERE store1 IS NOT NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT
  product_id,
  'store2',
  store2
FROM Products
WHERE store2 IS NOT NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT
  product_id,
  'store3',
  store3
FROM Products
WHERE store3 IS NOT NULL;
```
