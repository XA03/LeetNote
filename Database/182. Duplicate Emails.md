Write a solution to report all the duplicate emails. Note that it's guaranteed that the email field is not NULL.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

不跟自身比，最後用distinctg 去掉重複的值

```MySQL
select distinct a.email as 'Email' from Person as a,Person as b
where a.email=b.email and a.id!=b.id;
```
