Write a solution to report the IDs of all the employees with **missing information**. The information of an employee is missing if:

- The employee's **name** is missing, or
- The employee's **salary** is missing.

Return the result table ordered by `employee_id` **in ascending order**.

```MySQL
SELECT Employees.employee_id
FROM Employees
LEFT JOIN Salaries
  USING (employee_id)
WHERE Salaries.salary IS NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT Salaries.employee_id
FROM Salaries
LEFT JOIN Employees
  USING (employee_id)
WHERE Employees.name IS NULL
ORDER BY 1;
```
