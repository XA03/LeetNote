You are given an integer array `heights` representing the heights of buildings, some `bricks`, and some `ladders`.

You start your journey from building `0` and move to the next building by possibly using bricks or ladders.

While moving from building `i` to building `i+1` (**0-indexed**),

- If the current building's height is **greater than or equal** to the next building's height, you do **not** need a ladder or bricks.
- If the current building's height is **less than** the next building's height, you can either use **one ladder** or `(h[i+1] - h[i])` **bricks**.

_Return the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given ladders and bricks optimally._

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  int furthestBuilding(vector<int>& heights, int bricks, int ladders) {
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> minHeap;

    for (int i = 1; i < heights.size(); ++i) {
      const int diff = heights[i] - heights[i - 1];
      if (diff <= 0)
        continue;
      minHeap.push(diff);
      // If we run out of ladders, greedily use as less bricks as possible.
      if (minHeap.size() > ladders)
        bricks -= minHeap.top(), minHeap.pop();
      if (bricks < 0)
        return i - 1;
    }

    return heights.size() - 1;
  }
};
```
