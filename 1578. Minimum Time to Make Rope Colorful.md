Alice has `n` balloons arranged on a rope. You are given a **0-indexed** string `colors` where `colors[i]` is the color of the `ith` balloon.

Alice wants the rope to be **colorful**. She does not want **two consecutive balloons** to be of the same color, so she asks Bob for help. Bob can remove some balloons from the rope to make it **colorful**. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `neededTime` where `neededTime[i]` is the time (in seconds) that Bob needs to remove the `ith` balloon from the rope.

Return _the **minimum time** Bob needs to make the rope **colorful**_.

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  int minCost(string colors, vector<int>& neededTime) {
    int ans = 0;
    int maxNeededTime = neededTime[0];

    for (int i = 1; i < colors.length(); ++i)
      if (colors[i] == colors[i - 1]) {
        ans += min(maxNeededTime, neededTime[i]);
        // For each continuous group, Bob needs to remove every balloon except
        // the one with the maximum `neededTime`. So, he should hold the balloon
        // with the highest `neededTime` in his hand.
        maxNeededTime = max(maxNeededTime, neededTime[i]);
      } else {
        // If the current balloon is different from the previous one, discard
        // the balloon from the previous group and hold the new one in hand.
        maxNeededTime = neededTime[i];
      }

    return ans;
  }
};
