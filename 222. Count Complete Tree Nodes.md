Given the `root` of a **complete** binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to **[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees)**, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between `1` and `2h` nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than `O(n)` time complexity.

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
      return 0;

    TreeNode* left = root;
    TreeNode* right = root;
    int heightL = 0;
    int heightR = 0;

    while (left != nullptr) {
      ++heightL;
      left = left->left;
    }

    while (right != nullptr) {
      ++heightR;
      right = right->right;
    }

    if (heightL == heightR)  // `root` is a complete tree.
      return pow(2, heightL) - 1;
    return 1 + countNodes(root->left) + countNodes(root->right);
  }
};
```
