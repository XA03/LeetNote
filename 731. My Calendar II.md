You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a **triple booking**.

A **triple booking** happens when three events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to all the three events.).

The event can be represented as a pair of integers `start` and `end` that represents a booking on the half-open interval `[start, end)`, the range of real numbers `x` such that `start <= x < end`.

Implement the `MyCalendarTwo` class:

- `MyCalendarTwo()` Initializes the calendar object.
- `boolean book(int start, int end)` Returns `true` if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a **triple booking**. Otherwise, return `false` and do not add the event to the calendar.

```python
class MyCalendarTwo:

    def __init__(self):
        self.bookings = []
        self.overlap_bookings = []

    def book(self, start: int, end: int) -> bool:
        # Check if the new booking overlaps with any double-booked booking.
        for booking in self.overlap_bookings:
            if self.does_overlap(booking[0], booking[1], start, end):
                return False

        # Add any new double overlaps that the current booking creates.
        for booking in self.bookings:
            if self.does_overlap(booking[0], booking[1], start, end):
                self.overlap_bookings.append(
                    self.get_overlapped(booking[0], booking[1], start, end)
                )

        # Add the new booking to the list of bookings.
        self.bookings.append((start, end))
        return True

    # Return True if the booking [start1, end1) & [start2, end2) overlaps.
    def does_overlap(
        self, start1: int, end1: int, start2: int, end2: int
    ) -> bool:
        return max(start1, start2) < min(end1, end2)

    # Return the overlapping booking between [start1, end1) & [start2, end2).
    def get_overlapped(
        self, start1: int, end1: int, start2: int, end2: int
    ) -> tuple:
        return max(start1, start2), min(end1, end2)
