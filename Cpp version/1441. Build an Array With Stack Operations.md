**You are given an integer array `target` and an integer `n`.

You have an empty stack with the two following operations:

- **`"Push"`**: pushes an integer to the top of the stack.
- **`"Pop"`**: removes the integer on the top of the stack.

You also have a stream of the integers in the range `[1, n]`.

Use the two stack operations to make the numbers in the stack (from the bottom to the top) equal to `target`. You should follow the following rules:

- If the stream of the integers is not empty, pick the next integer from the stream and push it to the top of the stack.
- If the stack is not empty, pop the integer at the top of the stack.
- If, at any moment, the elements in the stack (from the bottom to the top) are equal to `target`, do not read new integers from the stream and do not do more operations on the stack.

Return _the stack operations needed to build_ `target` following the mentioned rules. If there are multiple valid answers, return **any of them**.**

把範圍1~n的值透過模擬Stack的操作放進陣列裡使元素排列和target一樣。

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> buildArray(vector<int>& target, int n) {
        vector<string>ans;
        int idx=0;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            if(idx==target.size())break;
            if(target[idx]==i){
                ans.push_back("Push");
                idx++;
            }
            else{
                ans.push_back("Push");
                ans.push_back("Pop");
            }
        }
        
        
        return ans;
    }
};
