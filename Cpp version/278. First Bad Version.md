You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API. 

只要某個版本出現錯誤，而後所有開發版本都會是錯誤的版本。

```cpp
int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int l=1,r=n,mid;
    
        while(l<=r){
            mid=l+(r-l)/2;
            
            if(!isBadVersion(mid))l=mid+1;
            else r=mid-1;
        }
        
        return l;
    }
