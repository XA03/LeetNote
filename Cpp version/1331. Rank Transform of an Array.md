Given an array of integers `arr`, replace each element with its rank.

The rank represents how large the element is. The rank has the following rules:

- Rank is an integer starting from 1.
- The larger the element, the larger the rank. If two elements are equal, their rank must be the same.
- Rank should be as small as possible.

Sort & Hash Map

先找出所有數字的大小順序再丟進Hash Map或Set中，最後用Hash Map 或 Set將陣列的值改成對應的Rank


```python
class Solution:
    def arrayRankTransform(self, arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        hmap={}
        s=sorted(set(arr))
        rank=1
        
        for i in s:
            hmap[i]=rank
            rank+=1
        
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            arr[i]=hmap[arr[i]]
            
        return arr
```
