A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in **non-decreasing order** by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array `expected` where `expected[i]` is the expected height of the `ith` student in line.

You are given an integer array `heights` representing the **current order** that the students are standing in. Each `heights[i]` is the height of the `ith` student in line (**0-indexed**).

Return _the **number of indices** where_ `heights[i] != expected[i]`.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int heightChecker(vector<int>& heights) {
        vector<int>sortedheights=heights;
        ranges::sort(sortedheights);
        
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=0;i<heights.size();i++)if(sortedheights[i]!=heights[i])ans++;
        
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
