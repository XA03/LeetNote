A **sentence** is a string of single-space separated words where each word consists only of lowercase letters.

A word is **uncommon** if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and **does not appear** in the other sentence.

Given two **sentences** `s1` and `s2`, return _a list of all the **uncommon words**_. You may return the answer in **any order**.

HashTable & Count

```python
class Solution(object):
    def uncommonFromSentences(self, s1, s2):
        count={}
        for word in s1.split():
            count[word]=count.get(word,0)+1
        for word in s2.split():
            count[word]=count.get(word,0)+1
        
        return [word for word in count if count[word]==1]
