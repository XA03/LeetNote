There are `n` students in a class numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The teacher will give each student a problem starting with the student number `0`, then the student number `1`, and so on until the teacher reaches the student number `n - 1`. After that, the teacher will restart the process, starting with the student number `0` again.

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `chalk` and an integer `k`. There are initially `k` pieces of chalk. When the student number `i` is given a problem to solve, they will use `chalk[i]` pieces of chalk to solve that problem. However, if the current number of chalk pieces is **strictly less** than `chalk[i]`, then the student number `i` will be asked to **replace** the chalk.

Return _the **index** of the student that will **replace** the chalk pieces_.

每個學生按照順序被問問題後都會拿走對應數量的粉筆，當有學生沒辦法拿滿時他就必須去補充粉筆。

找出這個補充粉筆的學生編號。

modulus

先將多餘的部分去除，再按照順序模擬

```python
class Solution:
    def chalkReplacer(self, chalk: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        flag=0;
        
        k%=sum(chalk)
        
        while k>=0 :
            if(k-chalk[flag]<0) :return flag
            k-=chalk[flag]
            flag+=1
            flag%=len(chalk)
        return -1
            
```
