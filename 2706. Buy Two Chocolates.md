You are given an integer array `prices` representing the prices of various chocolates in a store. You are also given a single integer `money`, which represents your initial amount of money.

You must buy **exactly** two chocolates in such a way that you still have some **non-negative** leftover money. You would like to minimize the sum of the prices of the two chocolates you buy.

Return _the amount of money you will have leftover after buying the two chocolates_. If there is no way for you to buy two chocolates without ending up in debt, return `money`. Note that the leftover must be non-negative.

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  int buyChoco(vector<int>& prices, int money) {
    int min1 = INT_MAX;
    int min2 = INT_MAX;

    for (const int price : prices)
      if (price <= min1) {
        min2 = min1;
        min1 = price;
      } else if (price < min2) {
        min2 = price;
      }

    const int minCost = min1 + min2;
    return minCost > money ? money : money - minCost;
  }
};
