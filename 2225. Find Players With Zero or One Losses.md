You are given an integer array `matches` where `matches[i] = [winneri, loseri]` indicates that the player `winneri` defeated player `loseri` in a match.

Return _a list_ `answer` _of size_ `2` _where:_

- `answer[0]` is a list of all players that have **not** lost any matches.
- `answer[1]` is a list of all players that have lost exactly **one** match.

The values in the two lists should be returned in **increasing** order.

**Note:**

- You should only consider the players that have played **at least one** match.
- The testcases will be generated such that **no** two matches will have the **same** outcome.

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  vector<vector<int>> findWinners(vector<vector<int>>& matches) {
    vector<vector<int>> ans(2);
    map<int, int> lossesCount;

    for (const vector<int>& m : matches) {
      const int winner = m[0];
      const int loser = m[1];
      if (!lossesCount.count(winner))
        lossesCount[winner] = 0;
      ++lossesCount[loser];
    }

    for (const auto& [player, nLosses] : lossesCount)
      if (nLosses < 2)
        ans[nLosses].push_back(player);

    return ans;
  }
};
