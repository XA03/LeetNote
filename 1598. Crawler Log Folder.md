The Leetcode file system keeps a log each time some user performs a _change folder_ operation.

The operations are described below:

- `"../"` : Move to the parent folder of the current folder. (If you are already in the main folder, **remain in the same folder**).
- `"./"` : Remain in the same folder.
- `"x/"` : Move to the child folder named `x` (This folder is **guaranteed to always exist**).

You are given a list of strings `logs` where `logs[i]` is the operation performed by the user at the `ith` step.

The file system starts in the main folder, then the operations in `logs` are performed.

Return _the minimum number of operations needed to go back to the main folder after the change folder operations._

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<string>& logs) {

        stack<string>folder;
        for(int i=0;i<logs.size();i++){
            string operation=logs[i].substr(0,logs[i].size()-1);
            if(operation==".")continue;
            else if(operation==".."){
                if(!folder.empty())folder.pop();
            }
            else {
                folder.push(operation);
            }
        }
        
        
        return folder.size();
    }
};
```
