In a town, there are `n` people labeled from `1` to `n`. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

1. The town judge trusts nobody.
2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties **1** and **2**.

You are given an array `trust` where `trust[i] = [ai, bi]` representing that the person labeled `ai` trusts the person labeled `bi`. If a trust relationship does not exist in `trust` array, then such a trust relationship does not exist.

Return _the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return_ `-1` _otherwise_.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findJudge(int n, vector<vector<int>>& trust) {
        vector<int>reputation(n,0);
        vector<bool>trustother(n,false);
        
        for(int i=0;i<trust.size();i++){
            reputation[trust[i][1]-1]++;
            trustother[trust[i][0]-1]=true;
        }
        
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(reputation[i]==n-1&&trustother[i]==false)return i+1;
        }     
        
        return -1;
    }
};
```
